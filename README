                   Welcome to Percy Project

  Procy project is an framework especially designed for Cassandra.
It's under developing right now. Use this framework, you can
manipulate Cassandra in an extremely easy way.

  Percy is based on Cassandra thrift API.

  Make a connection:

    conn = new Connection(ConnectionArgs.HOST, ConnectionArgs.PORT);
    conn.open();

  Create a keyspace:
    conn.createKeyspace(ConnectionArgs.KEYSPACE, Connection.SIMPLE_STRATGY, Connection.ONE_REPLICATION);

  Use a keyspace:
    conn.setKeyspace(ConnectionArgs.KEYSPACE);

  Create a column family:
    // Check sample code for Person class
    conn.createColumnFamily(Person.class);

  Destroy a column family:
    conn.dropColumnFamily(Person.class);

  Destroy a keyspace:
    conn.dropKeyspace(ConnectionArgs.KEYSPACE);



Roadmap:
  Create and drop counter family
  Insert and delete record into column family
  Manipulate counter(increase, decrease)
  Internal memory IO buffer(weak simulate for transaction support)
  General DAO and GeneralListDao for batch operation.
